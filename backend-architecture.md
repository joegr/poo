# DAO Governance System - Backend Architecture

## 1. Backend Components

### 1.1 Core Services
- **Proprietary Blockchain Node**: Custom blockchain implementation for all governance operations
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests with rate limiting and authentication
- **Governance Service**: Handles proposal creation, voting, and execution
- **Secure Treasury Service**: Manages treasury assets and stability mechanisms with enhanced security protocols
- **Analytics Service**: Processes governance data for visualization
- **Identity Service**: Manages member verification and Sybil resistance

### 1.2 Data Storage
- **Blockchain Data**: Primary source of truth for all governance actions
- **Time-Series Database**: For historical metrics (InfluxDB/TimescaleDB)
- **Document Store**: For proposal content and metadata (MongoDB)
- **Graph Database**: For relationship mapping between members and proposals (Neo4j)
- **Cache Layer**: For performance optimization (Redis)
- **Encrypted Storage**: For sensitive treasury operations and data

## 2. Infrastructure

### 2.1 Deployment Model
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: For orchestration of microservices
- **Multi-Region Deployment**: For resilience and low latency
- **Isolated Treasury Environment**: Air-gapped infrastructure for treasury operations
- **Content Delivery Network**: For static assets and frontend distribution

### 2.2 DevOps Pipeline
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for provisioning cloud resources
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and alerting
- **Logging**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation
- **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault for secure credential storage
- **Privileged Access Management**: For treasury system access control

## 3. Blockchain Implementation

### 3.1 Custom Chain Architecture
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Custom implementation optimized for governance operations
- **Smart Contract Layer**: Purpose-built for DAO governance functions
- **Transaction Processing**: Optimized for voting and proposal execution
- **Node Network**: Distributed validator network with Byzantine fault tolerance

### 3.2 Data Indexing
- **Custom Indexing Engine**: Purpose-built for the proprietary blockchain
- **Event Processing**: Stream processing for real-time updates
- **Cryptographic Verification**: For data integrity validation

## 4. Security Architecture

### 4.1 Security Measures
- **Multi-Signature Requirements**: For critical operations
- **Rate Limiting**: To prevent DoS attacks
- **Web Application Firewall**: For API protection
- **Intrusion Detection**: For identifying suspicious activities
- **Regular Security Audits**: Both automated and manual
- **Air-Gapped Treasury Systems**: Physical separation for highest security operations

### 4.2 Treasury Security
- **Restricted API Access**: Treasury API accessible only through secure channels
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: For all treasury operations
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)**: For cryptographic key storage
- **Privileged Session Recording**: Audit trail for all treasury access
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: No implicit trust for any treasury system access

### 4.3 Resilience
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic system protection mechanisms
- **Failover Systems**: For high availability
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups with disaster recovery testing
- **Chaos Engineering**: Proactive testing of system resilience

## 5. API Structure

### 5.1 Public REST APIs
- `/api/proposals`: Proposal management endpoints
- `/api/votes`: Voting endpoints
- `/api/members`: Member management endpoints
- `/api/metrics`: Public governance metrics endpoints

### 5.2 Secure Treasury API
- **Private Endpoint**: Not publicly documented or accessible
- **Encrypted Transport**: End-to-end encryption for all communications
- **Request Signing**: Cryptographic verification of all requests
- **Limited Functionality**: Minimal surface area for security
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: All operations recorded immutably

### 5.3 GraphQL API
- Unified query interface for complex data relationships
- Subscription support for real-time updates
- Granular permission controls for data access

## 6. Scalability Considerations

### 6.1 Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless services**: For easy replication
- **Database sharding**: For high-volume data
- **Read replicas**: For query-heavy operations

### 6.2 Performance Optimization
- **Query optimization and caching**
- **Asynchronous processing**: For non-critical operations
- **Batch processing**: For heavy computational tasks
- **Custom chain optimizations**: Performance tuning specific to governance operations
