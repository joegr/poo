# DAO Governance System

A comprehensive DAO governance platform built with Django, featuring quadratic voting, treasury management, and proposal systems.

## Architecture

This system follows the architecture specified in `backend-architecture.md` and implements the DAO governance model described in `dao.md`.

## Features

- Proposal creation, voting, and execution
- Quadratic voting mechanism with supermajority requirements
- Secure treasury management
- Member identity verification
- Analytics and metrics dashboard
- Multi-signature wallet integration
- GraphQL and REST API endpoints

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework, Graphene Django
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with D3.js for visualizations
- **Databases**: 
  - PostgreSQL (primary relational database)
  - MongoDB (document store for proposal content)
  - Neo4j (graph database for relationship mapping)
  - InfluxDB (time-series data for metrics)
  - Redis (caching and message broker)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform
- **Security**: JWT authentication, multi-factor authentication, rate limiting

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 14+
- MongoDB 6+
- Neo4j 5+
- Redis 7+

### Development Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dao-governance-system
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. Run database migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

### Docker Deployment

1. Build and start the containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

## Kubernetes Deployment

Refer to the `k8s/` directory for Kubernetes manifests and deployment instructions.

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints are protected with rate limiting
- Treasury operations require multi-signature approval
- Regular security audits are conducted
- Circuit breakers are implemented for critical operations
