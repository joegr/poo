# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Specification

## 1. Overview

This document specifies the governance structure and voting mechanisms for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that employs quadratic voting and supermajority requirements to make collective decisions on policy matters. The DAO incorporates Turing principles of computational universality and recursive improvement to ensure sustainable growth and treasury stability.

## 2. Governance Structure

### 2.1 Membership

- **Token-Based Membership**: Participation in the DAO is determined by ownership of governance tokens.
- **Identity Verification**: To prevent Sybil attacks, members must complete a verification process before participating in voting.
- **Delegation**: Members may delegate their voting power to other members.

### 2.2 Proposal System

- **Proposal Submission**: Any member holding at least 1% of the total governance tokens may submit a policy proposal.
- **Proposal Format**: Proposals must include:
  - Title and description
  - Rationale and expected impact
  - Implementation details
  - Timeline for execution
- **Proposal Lifecycle**:
  1. Submission
  2. Discussion period (14 days)
  3. Voting period (7 days)
  4. Implementation (if passed)

## 3. Voting Mechanism

### 3.1 Quadratic Voting

- **Voting Credits**: Each governance token grants the holder one voting credit per proposal.
- **Quadratic Cost**: The cost of votes follows a quadratic function: cost = votesÂ².
- **Example**:
  - 1 vote costs 1 credit
  - 2 votes cost 4 credits
  - 3 votes cost 9 credits
  - 10 votes cost 100 credits
- **Vote Direction**: Members may allocate their votes for or against a proposal.
- **Maximum Voting Power**: No single member may use more than 25% of the total voting credits in any single proposal.

### 3.2 Supermajority Requirement

- **Quorum**: At least 45% of all possible voting credits must be used for a vote to be valid.
- **Approval Threshold**: A proposal passes only if:
  1. At least 70% (two-thirds) of the cast votes are in favor

## 4. Treasury Management

- **Treasury Control**: The DAO treasury is controlled by a multi-signature wallet requiring approval from at least 5 of 9 elected guardians.
- **Guardian Election**: Guardians are elected quarterly using the same quadratic voting mechanism.
- **Spending Proposals**: Any expenditure from the treasury requires a successful proposal vote.
- **Treasury Stability Mechanism**: The DAO implements an algorithmic stability system with the following components:
  - **Reserve Ratio**: A minimum of 30% of treasury assets must be maintained in stable assets.
  - **Counter-cyclical Buffer**: Treasury accumulates reserves during growth periods and releases them during contractions.
- **Macro-Prudential Framework**: Treasury allocations follow a risk-weighted approach with exposure limits to any single asset class.

## 5. Policy Implementation

- **Execution Mechanism**: Approved policies are implemented through:
  - Smart contract updates
  - Parameter adjustments
  - Off-chain actions by designated executors
- **Timelock**: A 48-hour timelock period exists between approval and implementation to allow for security reviews.
- **Emergency Cancellation**: A proposal can be cancelled during the timelock if 75% of voting credits vote for cancellation.

## 6. Dispute Resolution

- **Arbitration Committee**: A rotating committee of 31 members selected randomly from the top 10% of token holders.
- **Dispute Process**: Members may raise disputes about proposal implementation within 72 hours of execution.
- **Resolution**: The committee will vote on the dispute. If a majority of the committee votes in favor of the proposal, the proposal will be implemented. If the committee votes against the proposal, the proposal will be reverted.

## 7. Amendment Process

- **Constitutional Amendments**: Changes to this specification require:
  - 14-day discussion period
  - 14-day voting period
  - 80% supermajority approval
  - 45% minimum quorum

## 8. Technical Implementation

- **Voting Interface**: A web-based dApp will facilitate proposal submission and voting.
- **Vote Calculation**: Votes are calculated and recorded on-chain for transparency.
- **Vote Privacy**: Members may opt for private voting through zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Vote Verification**: All votes are verifiable on-chain by any member.

## 9. Security Considerations

- **Smart Contract Audits**: All governance smart contracts must pass at least two independent security audits.
- **Gradual Rollout**: Voting power caps increase gradually as the DAO matures.

- **Circuit Breakers**: Emergency pause mechanisms exist for critical vulnerabilities.

## 10. Governance Incentives

- **Participation Rewards**: Members who participate in voting receive additional governance tokens proportional to their participation rate.
- **Long-term Alignment**: Governance tokens used for voting are locked for 30 days to ensure alignment with long-term interests.

## 11. Growth and Adaptation Mechanisms

- **Adaptive Parameters**: Key parameters automatically adjust based on treasury size, member count, and market conditions.
- **Growth Corridors**: The DAO defines sustainable growth corridors with automatic stabilizers when growth exceeds or falls below targets.
- **Halting Problem Recognition**: The governance system acknowledges the impossibility of predicting all future states and incorporates:
  - Circuit breakers for unexpected conditions
  - Human-in-the-loop fallbacks for complex decisions
  - Bounded rationality mechanisms that limit decision scope during uncertainty
- **State Transition Functions**: Treasury operations follow well-defined state transition functions with predictable outcomes.
- **Antifragile Design**: The DAO is designed to gain from disorder through:
  - Stress testing of governance mechanisms
  - Simulated attacks and response protocols
  - Convex payoff structures for beneficial risk-taking

## 12. Economic Stability Framework

- **Endogenous Growth Model**: The DAO implements mechanisms to ensure sustainable growth through:
  - **Productive Treasury Deployment**: Treasury assets are allocated to generate sustainable returns.
  - **Value Capture Mechanisms**: A portion of value created through DAO activities flows back to the treasury.
  - **Diminishing Returns Protection**: Algorithms prevent overinvestment in any single domain.
- **Macro Stability Indicators**: The DAO monitors key indicators including:
  - Treasury growth rate relative to ecosystem growth
  - Liquidity ratios across different timeframes
  - Governance token velocity and distribution metrics
  - External dependency risk factors
- **Feedback Stabilizers**: Automatic mechanisms adjust incentives and constraints based on stability indicators.
