Feature: Security Measures
  As a DAO
  I want to implement robust security measures
  So that the governance system and treasury are protected from attacks

  Background:
    Given the DAO governance system is operational

  Scenario: Smart contract security audits
    Given a new governance smart contract has been developed
    When the contract is submitted for security audits
    Then at least two independent security firms should audit the contract
    And all critical and high vulnerabilities must be resolved
    And the audit reports should be publicly available

  Scenario: Gradual voting power increase
    Given a new member has joined the DAO
    When they participate in their first governance vote
    Then their maximum voting power should be capped at 5%
    And after 3 months of active participation, the cap should increase to 10%
    And after 6 months of active participation, the cap should increase to 25%

  Scenario: Circuit breaker activation
    Given an unusual pattern of transactions is detected
    When the transaction volume exceeds 3 times the daily average
    Or a single transaction exceeds 20% of the treasury value
    Then the circuit breaker should be activated
    And all treasury transactions should be paused
    And guardians should be immediately notified

  Scenario: Rate limiting for API requests
    Given a user is interacting with the governance API
    When they make more than 60 requests per minute
    Then subsequent requests should be rate-limited
    And they should receive a 429 Too Many Requests response
    And the rate limiting event should be logged

  Scenario: Multi-factor authentication for critical operations
    Given I am a guardian
    When I attempt to approve a treasury transaction
    Then I should be required to provide a second factor of authentication
    And the operation should only proceed after successful verification

  Scenario: Detect and prevent flash loan attacks
    Given the system monitors for flash loan activity
    When a large number of governance tokens are acquired in a single block
    And immediately used for voting
    Then the votes should be flagged as suspicious
    And the guardians should be alerted to review the activity

  Scenario: Secure private key management
    Given a guardian needs to sign a transaction
    When they initiate the signing process
    Then the private key should never be exposed
    And the signing should occur in a secure hardware environment
    And all signing activities should be logged

  Scenario: Regular security penetration testing
    Given the governance platform is in production
    When quarterly security testing is conducted
    Then all identified vulnerabilities should be categorized by severity
    And critical vulnerabilities should be patched within 24 hours
    And high vulnerabilities should be patched within 7 days

  Scenario: Secure treasury operations with air-gapped systems
    Given a high-value treasury transaction needs to be executed
    When the transaction is prepared
    Then it should be signed on an air-gapped device
    And the signed transaction should be physically transferred to an online system
    And multiple guardians should verify the transaction before broadcast
