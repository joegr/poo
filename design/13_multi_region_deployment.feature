Feature: Multi-Region Deployment
  As a DAO platform operator
  I want to deploy the system across multiple geographic regions
  So that the platform is resilient, performant, and compliant with data regulations

  Background:
    Given the DAO governance system is designed for multi-region deployment
    And deployment infrastructure is available in multiple regions

  Scenario: Deploy primary infrastructure in main region
    Given infrastructure templates are defined
    When I deploy the primary infrastructure in the "us-east-1" region
    Then all core services should be provisioned
    And the services should be properly configured
    And health checks should pass for all components

  Scenario: Deploy replica infrastructure in secondary regions
    Given the primary infrastructure is operational in "us-east-1"
    When I deploy replica infrastructure in "eu-west-1" and "ap-southeast-1"
    Then all core services should be provisioned in each region
    And the services should be configured as replicas of the primary region
    And cross-region communication should be established

  Scenario: Database replication across regions
    Given PostgreSQL databases are deployed in multiple regions
    When data is written to the primary database
    Then the data should be replicated to all secondary regions
    And the replication lag should be less than 5 seconds
    And the system should handle replication conflicts appropriately

  Scenario: Traffic routing based on user location
    Given the system is deployed across multiple regions
    When a user accesses the platform
    Then they should be routed to the nearest available region
    And their experience should be consistent regardless of region
    And the routing decision should be logged for analysis

  Scenario: Region failover during outage
    Given all regions are operational
    When the primary region experiences an outage
    Then traffic should be automatically redirected to healthy regions
    And a secondary region should be promoted to primary if necessary
    And the failover should complete within 5 minutes
    And users should experience minimal disruption

  Scenario: Data synchronization after region recovery
    Given a region has recovered from an outage
    When the region rejoins the cluster
    Then data should be synchronized from the current primary region
    And the recovered region should catch up on missed transactions
    And once synchronized, it should resume normal operations

  Scenario: Cross-region security and compliance
    Given the system is deployed across multiple regions
    When I review the security configuration
    Then each region should enforce the same security policies
    And data sovereignty requirements should be respected
    And encryption keys should be properly managed across regions

  Scenario: Isolated treasury environment in each region
    Given the treasury system requires enhanced security
    When I deploy the treasury components
    Then each region should have an isolated treasury environment
    And cross-region treasury operations should require multi-region consensus
    And the treasury data should be replicated with additional encryption

  Scenario: Monitor performance across regions
    Given the monitoring system is configured for multi-region awareness
    When I view the global dashboard
    Then I should see performance metrics for each region
    And I should see cross-region latency measurements
    And I should be alerted about regional performance discrepancies

  Scenario: Deploy region-specific configuration
    Given different regions have different regulatory requirements
    When I deploy region-specific configurations
    Then each region should apply its specific regulatory settings
    And the core functionality should remain consistent across regions
    And the configuration differences should be documented and tracked
