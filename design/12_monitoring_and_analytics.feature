Feature: Monitoring and Analytics
  As a DAO administrator or member
  I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics capabilities
  So that I can track system health and governance metrics

  Background:
    Given the DAO governance system is operational
    And monitoring systems are configured

  Scenario: Monitor system health metrics
    When I access the system health dashboard
    Then I should see real-time metrics for:
      | Metric                | Status  |
      | API Response Time     | Normal  |
      | Database Performance  | Normal  |
      | Blockchain Node       | Synced  |
      | Memory Usage          | 45%     |
      | CPU Usage             | 30%     |
    And metrics should be updated at least every 30 seconds

  Scenario: Set up alerts for system issues
    Given I have configured alert thresholds
    When a system metric exceeds its threshold
    Then an alert should be triggered
    And the alert should be sent through configured channels
    And the alert should include details about the issue and severity

  Scenario: View governance participation metrics
    When I access the governance analytics dashboard
    Then I should see metrics for:
      | Metric                          | Value    |
      | Active Members                  | 1,250    |
      | Proposal Pass Rate              | 68%      |
      | Average Voter Turnout           | 52%      |
      | Average Discussion Participation| 23%      |
    And I should be able to filter metrics by time period

  Scenario: Generate treasury performance reports
    When I request a treasury performance report
    Then I should receive a report showing:
      | Metric                          | Value    |
      | Total Treasury Value            | $15.2M   |
      | Monthly Growth Rate             | 3.5%     |
      | Asset Diversification Score     | 82/100   |
      | Reserve Ratio                   | 35%      |
    And the report should include historical trend data
    And the report should be exportable in multiple formats

  Scenario: Track proposal analytics
    Given there are multiple proposals in the system
    When I view the proposal analytics
    Then I should see metrics on proposal types, outcomes, and participation
    And I should see the average time spent in each proposal phase
    And I should see correlations between proposal characteristics and outcomes

  Scenario: Monitor voting patterns
    When I access the voting analytics dashboard
    Then I should see visualizations of voting patterns
    And I should see distribution of voting power
    And I should see member engagement trends over time
    And unusual voting patterns should be highlighted

  Scenario: Log and audit security events
    Given security monitoring is enabled
    When a security-relevant event occurs
    Then the event should be logged with detailed context
    And the logs should be stored in a tamper-evident manner
    And the logs should be searchable for audit purposes

  Scenario: Visualize governance network
    When I access the governance network visualization
    Then I should see a graph representation of member relationships
    And delegation connections should be clearly visible
    And influential members should be highlighted
    And I should be able to explore the network interactively

  Scenario: Generate compliance reports
    When I request a compliance report
    Then I should receive a report showing:
      | Compliance Aspect                | Status    |
      | Quorum Requirements Met          | Yes       |
      | Voting Power Distribution        | Compliant |
      | Treasury Reserve Requirements    | Compliant |
      | Guardian Duties Fulfilled        | Yes       |
    And the report should include evidence for each compliance aspect
