Feature: Secure Treasury Service
  As a DAO
  I want an enhanced security treasury service
  So that financial assets are protected with the highest level of security

  Background:
    Given the DAO governance system is operational
    And the secure treasury service is deployed

  Scenario: Access treasury service through secure channels
    Given I am a guardian with treasury access permissions
    When I attempt to access the treasury service
    Then my connection should be encrypted with TLS 1.3
    And my request should be routed through a dedicated secure channel
    And my access attempt should be logged with detailed context

  Scenario: Multi-factor authentication for treasury access
    Given I am a guardian with treasury access permissions
    When I attempt to access the treasury service
    Then I should be required to provide my password
    And I should be required to provide a time-based one-time password
    And I should be required to confirm access via a hardware security key
    And access should be denied if any factor fails

  Scenario: Air-gapped signing for high-value transactions
    Given there is a high-value treasury transaction pending
    When the transaction requires signing
    Then the transaction details should be transferred to an air-gapped device
    And the transaction should be signed offline
    And the signature should be transferred back to the online system
    And the entire process should be documented and witnessed

  Scenario: Multi-region consensus for critical operations
    Given the treasury service is deployed across multiple regions
    When a critical treasury operation is initiated
    Then the operation should require approval from treasury services in multiple regions
    And a minimum of 2 regions must reach consensus
    And the operation should fail if consensus cannot be reached

  Scenario: Hardware security module integration
    Given the treasury service uses hardware security modules (HSMs)
    When cryptographic operations are performed
    Then private keys should never leave the HSM
    And all cryptographic operations should occur within the HSM
    And the HSM should enforce access control policies

  Scenario: Privileged session recording
    Given I am a guardian accessing the treasury service
    When I perform administrative actions
    Then my entire session should be recorded
    And the recording should include all commands and responses
    And the recording should be securely stored for audit purposes
    And the recording should be tamper-evident

  Scenario: Treasury operation request signing
    Given I want to initiate a treasury operation
    When I submit the request
    Then the request must be cryptographically signed
    And the signature must be verified before processing
    And the request should include a unique nonce to prevent replay attacks

  Scenario: Zero-trust architecture enforcement
    Given I have successfully authenticated to the treasury service
    When I attempt to access a specific treasury function
    Then my authorization should be verified for that specific function
    And my access should be time-limited
    And my access should be continuously validated throughout the session
    And any suspicious activity should trigger immediate session termination

  Scenario: Circuit breaker activation for suspicious activity
    Given the treasury service is monitoring for suspicious patterns
    When unusual transaction patterns are detected
    Then the treasury circuit breaker should be activated
    And all non-essential treasury operations should be paused
    And guardians should be immediately notified
    And manual review should be required to resume operations

  Scenario: Secure backup and recovery procedures
    Given the treasury service maintains encrypted backups
    When a recovery procedure is initiated
    Then the recovery should require multiple guardian approvals
    And the recovery should follow a documented procedure
    And each step of the recovery should be logged and verified
    And the recovered system should undergo security validation before resuming operations
